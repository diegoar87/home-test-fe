## ðŸ“Œ Important Notes

- Instructions for running the tests can be found in the **README.md**.  
- In Playwright, there is no need to implement setup/teardown code for opening and closing the browser â€” this is handled automatically by the framework.  
  - However, it is possible to apply **global setup and teardown** for other purposes, such as performing login via API or creating and cleaning up test data.  
- I do not see the need to implement **Page Objects** (a typical object-oriented programming pattern) in JavaScript, which is primarily functional.  
  - For this project, applying Page Objects would be unnecessary complexity and closer to over-engineering.

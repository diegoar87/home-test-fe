## ðŸ“Œ Important Notes

- Instructions for running the tests can be found in the **README.md**.  
- In Playwright, there is no need to implement setup/teardown code for opening and closing the browser â€” this is handled automatically by the framework.  
  - However, it is possible to apply **global setup and teardown** for other purposes, such as performing login via API or creating and cleaning up test data.  
- I chose not to apply the Page Object pattern in this project. Since JavaScript is not an OOP-focused language, I find functions more natural and maintainable.
  However, Page Objects can be used with Playwright, and I have successfully applied this pattern in other languages like C#.
- I am still working in some UI tests at this moment, I hope to complete them soon
- The API tests are written in JavaScript with Playwright. I also have experience developing API tests in Java, although it is a stack I havenâ€™t worked with in some time and would just need a short refresh
